# Triconicity (computing paradigm)

**Triconicity** is an advanced computational paradigm in which **code, data, and user interface (UI) are all embodied in a single, unified structural medium**, typically represented as a spatial grid or table. This concept generalizes the classical notion of **homoiconicity**—in which **code and data share the same structure**—by incorporating the **user interface** itself as a manifestation of the same underlying form. In a triconic system, program logic, data structures, and interactive visual components are not just linked but **are structurally identical**, represented and manipulated in the same format.

## Concept

Triconicity is most commonly illustrated using **grids, spreadsheets, or CSV-like tabular structures**, interpreted through a model known as **Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS)**. In this framework:

- **Filled and empty cells within a grid convey semantic meaning** based on their spatial arrangement, not just their content.
- The **grid itself functions simultaneously as the program’s code**, its data, and its interface.
- Editing cells modifies the program logic, changes the data model, and updates the interface—all in real time—because these are not separate layers but **different views of the same structure**.

Thus, triconicity allows users to interact with software by **directly reshaping a single, spatially organized system**, effectively performing programming, data manipulation, and UI configuration in one seamless act.

## Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS)

Triconicity builds on the principle of **Binary Spatial Semantics**, wherein:

- The layout of filled versus empty cells forms patterns that encode meaning structurally.
- Relationships such as hierarchy, grouping, flow, or type are inferred from **spatial proximity and arrangement**, rather than from syntax or metadata.
- Structures like tables, trees, conditional blocks, and interactive panels emerge naturally from how cells are organized in space.

There is no need for markup, tags, or hidden code—the **structure is the syntax**, and meaning is visually apparent.

## Significance

Triconicity enables a radically integrated approach to software creation and interaction:

- **Total cohesion**: Programming, data entry, and interface design occur in the same medium.
- **Live modification**: Applications can be changed on the fly by reshaping their own structure.
- **Immediate semantic visibility**: There is no hidden logic—structure is the meaning.

Triconicity points toward a future in which software is **fully inspectable, malleable, and self-representing**, empowering users to modify it as naturally as they might edit a spreadsheet.

- **Homoiconicity**: The foundation for triconicity, where code and data share the same structural form.
- **Live coding / live programming**: Environments that support real-time software modification.
- **Visual programming**: Often shares goals of transparency and manipulability, though usually separates code and UI.
- **Reflective systems**: Capable of modifying their own structure.
- **Spreadsheet computing**: A precursor to triconic systems, though traditionally lacking structural unity between code, data, and UI.
