# Binary Spatial Semantics: A New Paradigm for 2D Data Representation

## Abstract

This paper introduces Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS), a novel framework for interpreting 2D grids where the spatial relationships between set cells take precedence over their individual content. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on the data within each cell, BSS emphasizes the relative positioning of set cells (analogous to spreadsheet cells) to derive meaning from their arrangement and structure, allowing for more sophisticated data representations. This method is particularly effective when applied to CSV files, where the filled versus unset cells create a spatial map that can encode complex structures such as API data layers, object hierarchies, or even the source code of entire programs, including their file systems, within a single file. While text inside the cells can contribute to the semantics, the primary layer of meaning is derived from the spatial layout, making BSS a powerful tool for interpreting 2D arrays in dynamic new ways. Key applications of BSS include visual programming interfaces, advanced data visualization, and novel paradigms for manipulating hierarchical and recursive data structures. This paper explores the foundational principles of Binary Spatial Semantics, provides practical examples of its use, and outlines its potential for future research in data representation, programming, and visualization.

## Introduction

In traditional data structures, particularly those represented as 2D arrays, the emphasis is typically placed on the content of individual cells—whether numeric, textual, or binary data. While this approach serves many applications well, it overlooks the potential for spatial relationships within the data to convey more sophisticated meanings. Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS) introduces a paradigm shift by focusing on the positional relationships between cells, rather than their content, especially when they are represented as binary values for the filled vs non-set cells.

The core concept of BSS is that the arrangement of ‘1’ bits in a 2D binary array can represent complex data structures, logical hierarchies, or even programmatic concepts. By interpreting the spatial positioning of set cells relative to each other, BSS encodes meaning directly into the structure itself, creating a new level of abstraction in data representation. This stands in contrast to traditional approaches, where each cell’s data is treated as independent and significant only in terms of its content.

CSV files, commonly used for tabular data, provide an ideal medium for applying BSS. While CSVs are traditionally viewed as simple, flat representations of data, BSS reinterprets them as spatial maps of binary values. In this context, the set cells (non-empty values) form the backbone of more complex, multi-layered structures. By leveraging the spatial arrangement of cells, CSV files can be transformed into constructs such as object schemas, file system hierarchies, or even the source code of entire programs—all encapsulated within a single file.

The potential applications of Binary Spatial Semantics extend well beyond data visualization. By harnessing the spatial relationships inherent in binary structures, BSS enables the development of novel programming interfaces, such as 2D visual programming environments, where users interact with data across multiple levels of abstraction. These environments offer a unique way to manipulate data, where the position of each element in the grid contributes to its semantic meaning. BSS thus transforms 2D grids into spatial canvases where data, logic, and code converge, providing a more intuitive and flexible framework for managing complex systems.

This paper explores the foundational principles of Binary Spatial Semantics and demonstrates its utility through practical examples and use cases. Whether representing API data layers or encoding entire program structures, BSS offers a powerful new framework for interpreting and utilizing 2D binary data. Through this investigation, we aim to reveal the transformative potential of BSS and provide a roadmap for future research and development in this emerging field.

## Related Works

Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS) stands at the intersection of several established technologies and paradigms, each contributing to the theoretical and practical framework of this approach. BSS builds upon and extends these existing methods for data representation, programming interfaces, and spatial computing. This section reviews the most pertinent areas of research and technology that lay the foundation for BSS.

### Tabular Data Representation and CSV Files

BSS is closely tied to the concept of tabular data as embodied by CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. CSVs, ubiquitous in data management, have traditionally served as a lightweight, human-readable format for storing and exchanging data. While CSV files are typically flat representations, BSS reinterprets them to encode complex, spatially driven semantics. By viewing CSVs as 2D data structures, BSS allows the spatial arrangement of data points to carry as much meaning as the data itself.

This reimagining of CSVs echoes Douglas Crockford's approach with JSON. Similar to how JSON evolved from a simple format into a powerful data interchange standard, BSS aims to extend the utility of CSV files into a dynamic, recursive, and spatial medium for data representation.
Data Visualization and Spatial Computing

Deriving meaning from spatial arrangements is a well-established concept in data visualization and spatial computing. Techniques such as heatmaps, node-link diagrams, and tree maps leverage spatial relationships to communicate patterns and hierarchies within data. BSS extends these ideas by embedding semantic meaning directly into the spatial positioning of binary data in 2D arrays.

The influence of spatial computing is clear, with applications like Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Visual Programming Languages (VPLs) (such as LabVIEW) demonstrating how spatial relationships can be used to encode logic. Margaret Burnett's work on VPLs highlights the use of multiple dimensions to convey semantics, a core principle in BSS. While GIS applies spatial logic to physical spaces, BSS applies similar principles to abstract data, embedding meaning into grid-based structures.

### Programming Paradigms: 2D Arrays and Grid-Based Logic

The use of 2D arrays in BSS builds on a well-established tradition in programming, where 2D grids form the basis for various data structures, such as matrices, game boards, or image processing. In particular, cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life showcase how simple binary rules applied to a grid can generate complex behaviors—a principle central to BSS. BSS takes this further by allowing spatial positioning of cells on the grid to define logic and relationships, turning grids into both a data structure and a logic engine.

Jonathan Edwards has been a prominent critic of linear text-based programming, advocating for non-linear representations of code. His notion of schematic tables, where 2D structures collapse complex logic, aligns closely with BSS’s approach. Edwards’ statement, "The right notation should embody the semantics of its domain," resonates deeply with BSS's philosophy of embedding semantics directly into spatial relationships.

### Tree Structures and Hierarchical Data Representation

BSS leverages traditional hierarchical data structures, like trees, in a novel way. Where technologies like JSON and XML represent trees in a purely textual format, BSS allows parent-child relationships to be represented spatially, embedding these relationships within the 2D grid itself. This spatial organization makes it easier to visualize and manipulate complex hierarchical structures.

Like LISP and SICP, which represent nested data through parentheses, BSS uses spatial positioning to represent these nested relationships. In fact, Harold Abelson, in the famous MIT "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) course, suggested that if LISP were invented today, it might use a 2D structure instead of parentheses. BSS is an actualization of this idea, using spatial semantics to replace the need for a linear representation.
Spreadsheets as Programming Environments

Spreadsheets like Excel and Google Sheets have long been used for more than just data storage, evolving into functional programming environments where users perform complex data manipulations. BSS takes the spreadsheet paradigm further, treating spatial relationships between cells as a programming construct. By using the grid as a canvas for 2D structures, BSS transforms a spreadsheet into a powerful programming environment where the position of cells within the grid defines the structure and behavior of data.
Much like how Excel's Power Query and Google Sheets’ Apps Script provide formulaic, grid-based programming, BSS treats the entire grid as a programming interface. The accessibility of spreadsheets, combined with BSS’s power to encode hierarchical and recursive data, makes it a natural evolution of the spreadsheet programming model.

### Visual Programming and Flow-Based Programming

Visual programming tools like LabVIEW and Max/MSP allow users to manipulate nodes and connections to represent computational processes. Similarly, flow-based programming (FBP) systems visualize the flow of data between components, treating data as "streams" flowing through a network. BSS takes a different but related approach by using the grid itself to represent relationships and data. While FBP focuses on data flow between nodes, BSS focuses on the spatial positioning of data within a 2D array.

This spatial logic echoes the way circuit design tools (such as Verilog and VHDL) use spatial relationships to encode logical operations across 2D spaces. In the same way that circuits encode function in 2D space, BSS encodes complex relationships within its binary grids.

### Recursive Data Structures and Representations

One of the more advanced capabilities of BSS is its support for recursive data structures. In BSS, blocks within a grid can zoom into sub-grids, representing lower-level structures inside a single cell. This recursive layering is common in functional programming languages like LISP, where nested data and functions represent complex hierarchies.

BSS applies a similar recursive principle but does so visually, allowing users to zoom in and out of hierarchical data structures in 2D space. The ability to recursively manage and visualize deeply nested data in a spatial framework opens new possibilities for recursive data management, processing, and visualization.

### Data Flow Programming

Finally, BSS finds conceptual alignment with Data Flow Programming, where operations are triggered as soon as their inputs are ready. This non-linear approach to computation mirrors how BSS treats data blocks. In Data Flow systems, nodes fire when they have the necessary inputs; similarly, in BSS, data points in a grid can trigger other actions based on their spatial relationships. The “firing” of nodes in Data Flow Programming resonates with the spatial execution of logic in BSS, allowing for complex workflows to emerge from simple binary relationships.

### Conclusion

Binary Spatial Semantics builds upon a rich history of concepts in tabular data representation, spatial computing, hierarchical structures, and visual programming. By integrating these ideas into a unified framework, BSS transcends traditional boundaries in programming and data representation, offering a novel way to encode, visualize, and manipulate data. This review of related works shows how BSS extends these existing paradigms, pushing the frontiers of spatial programming and semantic data interpretation.

## Methodology/Design

Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS) introduces a novel framework for interpreting 2D arrays of binary values by focusing on the spatial relationships between set cells rather than the specific contents of the cells themselves. This section provides an in-depth explanation of BSS’s design principles, breaking down how blocks, clusters, and custom pattern definitions work, and discussing how users can leverage BSS to define complex structures like trees, tables, and recursive relationships within a grid.

1.  Overview of the 2D Grid Structure

    At the foundation of BSS is the 2D grid, represented as a binary array where cells can be either filled (represented by a 1) or unfilled (represented by a 0). In BSS, meaning is derived from the relative positioning of set cells, which form the basis for more advanced data structures like blocks, trees, tables, and clusters.

    In practice, CSV files—commonly used to store tabular data—become the medium for implementing this system. The grid of filled and unset cells, along with their arrangement, forms the canvas where users define and interpret meaning. This structure allows for rich data representations that can evolve as users interact with the grid.

2.  Blocks, Cell Clusters, and Block Clusters

    A key concept in BSS is the block, which consists of a canvas (set cells), surrounded by a border and a frame. These components are always rectangular, but the set cells within the canvas can form irregular shapes, like trees or tables. Importantly, the arrangement of the set cells within the canvas (known as a cell cluster) defines the internal structure of the block.

    - Canvas: Contains the set cells that represent data or logic elements.
    - Border: A layer of empty cells around the canvas, visually separating the block from surrounding content.
    - Frame: Another layer of empty cells surrounding the border, enabling higher-order relationships with other blocks.

    Blocks are dynamic; when a user fills a cell near an existing block (within two cells), the block expands to incorporate the new set cell, maintaining its rectangular shape but adjusting the internal cell cluster(s). The arrangement of set cells within the block’s canvas can give rise to various structures, such as trees, tables, or other entities. Multiple patterns may coexist on the same canvas—trees and tables can appear side by side or even intermix with one another, creating complex, multi-patterned structures within a single block. This dynamic allows for highly flexible representations of data, where different logical entities can be layered and combined within the same space.

    While individual blocks are constrained to rectangular shapes, block clusters—formed by overlapping or neighboring blocks—can have irregular configurations. When blocks overlap or are placed near each other, each pair of blocks in that cluster may be linked or locked with each other, depending upon if only their frames overlap or if either frame overlaps the border of the other, creating higher-level relationships between blocks. These block clusters are not bound by the same constraints as individual blocks, allowing for more complex and organic arrangements.

3.  Custom Pattern Definitions for Parsing Clusters

    A major component of BSS is the ability to define custom pattern definitions that the parser can use to recognize and interpret specific structures, both within a block (cell cluster) and across multiple blocks (block cluster). These custom patterns allow users to define structures like trees with embedded tables or tables with nested trees, and the parser can recognize these patterns even when they are transposed or oriented differently (horizontally or vertically).

    Custom pattern definitions can be thought of as a way to define templates for cell clusters and block clusters:

    - Cell Cluster Patterns: Templates that define the shapes or structures formed by the arrangement of set cells within a block’s canvas. For instance, a table pattern might expect a rectangular group of set cells, while a tree pattern would require parent-child relationships between cells (e.g., one row down, one column to the right for each child).
    - Block Cluster Patterns: Templates that define how blocks relate to one another spatially, without the constraint of a canvas. These patterns could involve blocks being linked (frames overlapping) or locked (frames and borders overlapping), representing a hierarchical or associative relationship between data structures.

    These pattern definitions enable users to teach the parser to recognize complex combinations of structures. For example, a pattern might define that any block with “API Definition” in the top-left cell should be followed by a tree structure representing the object hierarchy, with a table to the right containing validation rules and another table to its right containing the data.

4.  Recursive Structures and Higher-Order Grids

    One of the most powerful features of BSS is its ability to support recursive structures. Users can define grids within grids by zooming into a single cell in a block to reveal a lower-level grid within that cell. This allows users to recursively nest structures within lower level grids. Alternatively, higher level virtual grids allow a grid full of blocks to be treated as a higher level grid where the contents of each set cell is the block cluster found at that location in the original grid. These recursive structures, whether lower level physical grids or higher level virtual grids, could continue ad infinitum and even be replaced with pointers to a previously defined grid to allow a sort of multi-layered loop, often called a strange loop.

    To manage recursive data structures:

    - Zoom-In/Zoom-Out: Users can enter a lower grid level (by selecting a cell and pressing a key like F3), where they can create a sub-grid. Upon exiting (ESC), the sub-grid is stored in the original cell as CSV, representing that internal grid.

    These recursive capabilities allow BSS to handle complex hierarchical data across multiple layers of abstraction while still retaining the ability to reuse the same parsing logic and pattern definitions at any level of abstraction.

5.  Syntax Highlighting, Dynamic Formatting, and Object Extraction

    Much like traditional IDEs, BSS applies syntax highlighting to the grid to visually distinguish between different data structures:

    - Tree Nodes and Connectors: Highlighted lines show parent-child relationships between cells in a tree.
    - Table Formatting: Tables are formatted with bold headers and alternating row colors to visually distinguish between data rows and metadata rows.
    - Custom Pattern Visualization: Once the parser identifies a custom pattern (e.g., a table with an embedded tree), the formatting adjusts accordingly, visually showing the type of structure identified.

    In addition to visual representation, BSS allows the parser to extract logical structures from the grid and convert them into traditional programming objects. For instance, an API schema defined within a BSS grid could be parsed and converted into a JSON object or an API validation framework, depending on the pattern detected.

6.  Dynamic Cluster Templates and Backus-Naur Form for BSS

    To facilitate the creation and recognition of custom patterns, BSS could employ a Backus-Naur Form (BNF)-like system to define the rules and patterns that the parser should look for in the grid. BNF is commonly used to define the grammar of programming languages, and a similar approach could be used to define the positional grammar of BSS patterns.
    Using BSS itself, users could define:

    - Cell Cluster Templates: A formal definition of patterns within a block’s canvas, such as trees with table nodes.
    - Block Cluster Templates: Definitions of how blocks should relate spatially in a cluster, such as linked blocks representing row by row similarities between disparate versions of object schemas.

    This approach would allow users to define new templates for the parser to recognize, effectively teaching it how to detect new types of structures and extract them as data objects.

7.  Implementation Considerations

    The implementation of BSS requires a robust interface capable of parsing grids dynamically in real time. The parser must be able to:

    1. Grid Parsing: Continuously analyze the 2D grid to detect set cells, form blocks, and interpret clusters.
    2. Dynamic Formatting: Apply visual formatting to reflect the type of structure detected.
    3. Custom Pattern Detection: Identify user-defined cell and block cluster patterns to format and process data accordingly.
    4. Object Extraction: Convert identified patterns into data objects, such as JSON schemas or other programmatic representations.
       Additionally, performance optimizations are needed to handle large grids and complex recursive structures without lag.

8.  Basic Visualization and Interaction

    To illustrate how Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS) operates at a foundational level, we will walk through a simple example using an 8x8 binary grid, demonstrating how set cells form blocks, how blocks are manipulated, and how more complex structures like trees and tables emerge.

    1. Initial Block Formation

       Consider an 8x8 grid where some cells are filled (represented by 1s) and others are unfilled (0s). The arrangement of these set cells determines the formation of a block. As an example, a single set cell will trigger the creation of a block with a canvas, border, and frame.
       [Placeholder for Visual: An 8x8 binary grid with a single set cell in the middle, showing the canvas, border, and frame formation.]
       In this initial state, the block is defined as:

       - Canvas: The set cell.
       - Border: A layer of empty cells immediately surrounding the canvas.
       - Frame: An outer layer of empty cells surrounding the border.

       The background colors of the canvas, border, and frame cells are highlighted to visually distinguish these components. This shows how the system identifies and isolates the block within the grid.

    2. Moving the Block Across the Grid

       Once the block is formed, the user can interact with it. By pressing a Ctrl + arrow key, the entire block—canvas, border, and frame—can be moved across the grid, maintaining its rectangular structure as though it is “floating” above the grid.

       > [Placeholder for Visual: The same block being moved one column to the right on the grid, illustrating how the entire block shifts position.]

       This movement allows users to reposition blocks dynamically, facilitating organization and interaction with different parts of the grid.

    3. Block Expansion

       Next, we illustrate how blocks expand when additional cells are filled near them. If a user fills a cell within two cells of the canvas of the existing block, the block will automatically expand to encompass the new set cell. This expansion includes adjustments to the canvas, border, and frame.

       > [Placeholder for Visual: The initial block expanding to include a neighboring set cell, with the canvas, border, and frame adjusting to cover the newly set cell.]

       The expansion allows blocks to grow and evolve as users interact with the grid, ensuring that adjacent cells are logically grouped within a single block.

    4. Tree and Table Structures

       To demonstrate more complex patterns, we now introduce two distinct structures commonly represented in BSS: trees and tables.

       - Tree: A tree structure is formed when set cells are arranged hierarchically. For example, a parent cell in the canvas has children that are positioned one row down and one column to the right.

       > [Placeholder for Visual: A simple tree structure formed by set cells within the canvas, showing parent-child relationships.]

       - Table: A table is formed when set cells are arranged in rows and columns. The first row is treated as the header row, and subsequent rows are the data rows.

       > [Placeholder for Visual: A simple table structure formed by set cells, showing header and data rows.]

    5. Combining Tree and Table Structures

       In many practical applications, trees and tables can be combined within the same block or across adjacent blocks. For example, a tree structure may define an object hierarchy, while a table adjacent to it defines validation rules or properties.

       > [Placeholder for Visual: A block showing a tree structure next to a table structure, illustrating how both can coexist and interact.]

       By visually combining these structures, BSS enables users to represent complex relationships in a single, unified grid, facilitating both spatial and logical organization of data.
       Evaluation/Results

       As of this writing, Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS) has been implemented in early versions through traditional tools like Excel, and the next step is developing a web-based version. Although concrete results from large-scale user testing or case studies are not yet available, we can begin to evaluate the potential impact, effectiveness, and paradigm shifts that BSS could introduce. This section will explore speculative results based on anticipated user interaction with the system, the performance benefits of the unified 2D programming interface, and the broader implications of integrating BSS into web APIs, data validation, and even hardware-level computing.

9.  Potential User Interaction Outcomes

    Once a web-based interface for BSS is available, users could build out a variety of data structures—such as API definitions, object schemas, and programs—all within a single, spatial grid interface. This unified system offers several potential outcomes:

    - Simplified API Development: By using BSS to define API endpoints, object schemas, and validation rules, developers could integrate all aspects of an API into one visual and interactive environment. Users could map out the relationships between different endpoints, data objects, and logic in a way that visually makes sense, eliminating the need for separate JSON or XML schema files.
    - Result: Increased clarity in API design. Developers would be able to see API relationships as blocks on the grid, making it easier to visualize the flow of data between endpoints and objects. The ability to combine API logic, data validation, and schema definitions into a single, transferable file (e.g., CSV) would reduce development time and simplify maintenance.
    - Program Migration and Integration: BSS could allow developers to migrate existing program files (code, objects, schemas) into the grid interface, making it possible to visualize how different components fit together within a single framework.
    - Result: This visual approach could dramatically reduce complexity when working with large codebases. By treating program files and folder hierarchies as spatial blocks, users could better understand the relationships between different modules or classes, making it easier to refactor or optimize code.
    - Unified Data Format: The CSV format underlying BSS allows all data, object schemas, validation rules, and program logic to be stored in a single file. When transmitted over HTTP, this unified format could significantly reduce the need for additional middleware, simplifying the exchange of both data and logic between client and server.
    - Result: Potential to streamline web development by integrating multiple programming aspects (data, schema, validation, logic) into one easily transmittable medium. This would reduce API overhead and open up new possibilities for sending program logic, not just data, over the web.

10. The Impact on API Design and Web Communication

    As BSS evolves, one of the most transformative possibilities is the way it could redefine API communication over the web. Current web APIs rely heavily on REST or GraphQL, where data and endpoints are treated separately from the logic and validation rules that govern them. BSS has the potential to unify these disparate components by embedding logic, validation, and schema into the same medium used for transmitting data.

    - Result: Web communication could evolve beyond just exchanging raw data, allowing APIs to send entire object definitions, validation rules, and program logic in a single transmission. This could reduce the complexity of managing state across multiple systems and eliminate the need for external validation processes. Furthermore, if the system is capable of recursively nesting program logic within cells, APIs could handle complex, self-describing payloads that minimize manual coding effort on both the client and server sides.

    This could also shift the paradigm for how web APIs operate. With logic, schemas, and validation built directly into the same transmittable format, BSS might eliminate the need for separate API documentation tools or schema validation systems. Everything could be integrated directly into the spatial data layer.

11. Beyond Traditional Programming: BSS in Wave Computing

    Perhaps one of the most profound theoretical outcomes of BSS is its potential to break new ground in hardware programming and introduce alternative computing paradigms. By using the BSS grid to map recursive structures—where each cell can contain a nested program that communicates with other cells—new methods of broadcast-based wave computing could emerge. This differs from linear, sequential computation models and opens up the possibility of grid-based systems where cells interact through signals rather than direct data transfer.

    - Result: Imagine a grid of cells, where each cell represents a small program with the ability to broadcast signals to other cells in response to certain conditions. These cells could listen for signals and execute operations based on their relative position in the grid. If mapped to an FPGA-style board, this could lead to hardware-based wave computing, where logic is executed across a network of transceiver-equipped nodes. By simulating this grid-based broadcast system in BSS, entirely novel algorithms could be devised—algorithms that exploit spatial relationships and signal propagation, rather than conventional step-by-step logic.
    - Limitations: While speculative, the real-world implementation of such wave computing systems would require significant advancements in both hardware and signal processing techniques. Moreover, adapting BSS to such systems would involve a more sophisticated recursive and communication framework that may not yet exist.

12. Limitations and Trade-Offs

    While the potential applications of BSS are exciting, it is important to recognize several key limitations and trade-offs that may arise during development and real-world implementation:

    - Performance Overhead: Parsing large 2D grids to detect spatial relationships, apply recursive structures, and dynamically format the canvas in real time could lead to performance bottlenecks, particularly with larger datasets or complex programs. This is especially true when expanding the system to support nested grids and zoom-in/zoom-out functionality.
    - Mitigation: Performance optimization will be critical, possibly requiring the use of WebAssembly or other high-performance browser technologies to manage large data structures efficiently.
    - Learning Curve: For developers unfamiliar with spatial or visual programming paradigms, BSS may introduce a steep learning curve. Traditional programming languages rely on well-established text-based workflows, and switching to a grid-based, spatially aware system might initially reduce productivity for some users.
    - Mitigation: User education and well-designed tutorials would be essential in helping developers transition to a BSS-based workflow. Additionally, gradual adoption, starting with small-scale data tasks (e.g., API schema design), could ease this learning curve.
    - Complexity of Nested Structures: While BSS’s recursive capabilities offer powerful ways to represent nested data and programs, the recursive depth of certain data structures may make it difficult to navigate or manage visually.
    - Mitigation: Implementing intuitive zoom and navigation tools, along with breadcrumb-like indicators, will be essential for helping users understand and manage deep recursive structures.

13. Anticipated Case Studies and Benchmarks

    Once the BSS system is fully implemented, we anticipate the following benchmarks and case studies could be used to validate its effectiveness:

    - API Development Case Study: Test the ability of developers to design, test, and maintain complex API schemas using BSS as the sole interface. Measure the time savings compared to traditional API development tools (e.g., Postman, Swagger) and the reduction in API documentation overhead.
    - Performance Benchmarks: Evaluate the system’s ability to handle large, complex grids with thousands of cells, particularly when blocks are moved or resized. Performance metrics would focus on response time, grid parsing speed, and rendering performance when interacting with large recursive structures.
    - Programming Interface Usability Study: Compare the usability and productivity of BSS with traditional text-based programming languages, particularly in the context of complex hierarchical data structures (e.g., nested JSON objects or database schemas).

### Conclusion

Although full-scale testing and user trials of BSS have yet to be conducted, the potential results indicate a significant shift in the way data, logic, and program structures are represented and manipulated. From simplifying API design to introducing novel computing paradigms like wave computing, BSS offers a promising framework for the future of spatial programming. Further work will validate the performance, usability, and scalability of the system, opening up new avenues for research and development.
Discussion

The results and possibilities outlined for Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS) point toward a broader shift in how we approach data representation, programming interfaces, and communication protocols. BSS introduces a new paradigm where the spatial relationships between data points, rather than the data itself, become the primary mechanism for semantic meaning. This shift from content-driven to structure-driven interpretation has far-reaching implications across various domains of technology.

1. Implications for Programming and Technology

   At its core, BSS redefines how we think about programming interfaces and data structures. By treating a 2D grid of cells as a dynamic programming environment, BSS enables more intuitive, spatially organized development workflows. This could lead to new programming methodologies where visualizing data and code structures becomes as important as writing them. In traditional software development, the complexity of understanding hierarchies and relationships is often hidden within layers of abstraction. BSS offers the potential to expose these relationships in a visual and interactive way, which may enhance developer productivity and reduce complexity in areas such as API design, data modeling, and recursive programming.

   Additionally, BSS could influence the design of integrated development environments (IDEs) by introducing new ways to interact with code. Current IDEs focus on text-based manipulation of code, but with BSS, developers could visually manipulate logical structures—such as object hierarchies or file systems—within the same workspace. This could lead to more efficient workflows in schema generation, data validation, and even program execution.

2. Limitations and Challenges

   Despite its potential, several limitations and challenges remain in the implementation and adoption of BSS:

   - Learning Curve: The visual and spatial nature of BSS might present a learning curve for developers who are accustomed to traditional text-based coding. Although BSS is intuitive in theory, the transition from existing paradigms to a spatially-driven one could pose a challenge, especially for developers who are deeply entrenched in conventional workflows.
   - Performance Constraints: As grids expand and recursive structures deepen, the performance of a BSS-based system could suffer. Parsing and rendering large grids in real-time, especially when handling dynamic data structures and recursive zooming, will require efficient algorithms and potentially hardware acceleration.
   - Tooling and Infrastructure: Integrating BSS into mainstream software development workflows will require the development of new tools, libraries, and frameworks. Currently, no major programming languages or frameworks support the kind of spatial semantics that BSS relies on. A significant investment would be required to build and optimize these systems.

3. Future Work and Improvements

   To address these limitations, future work in BSS should focus on the following areas:

   - Optimized Algorithms for Grid Parsing: Further research is needed to develop more efficient algorithms that can dynamically parse and interpret large 2D grids in real-time without performance degradation. Leveraging technologies such as WebAssembly for browser-based applications could provide the performance boost necessary to handle complex recursive structures.
   - User Education and Onboarding: Educational resources and onboarding tools must be developed to help new users understand the BSS paradigm. Interactive tutorials, guided examples, and real-world use cases will be essential in driving adoption.
   - Hardware Integration: A more speculative but exciting area of future work lies in exploring how BSS could be implemented at the hardware level. The concept of wave computing or grid-based node interaction opens the door to new forms of computation that leverage spatial relationships rather than linear processes. Future research should explore how BSS can integrate with FPGAs or other hardware platforms to unlock novel computing architectures.

4. Potential Applications and Industry Impact

   BSS could have a transformative impact across multiple industries:

   - Web Development and API Design: BSS’s unified data format could streamline web development, allowing APIs to exchange not just data but also logic and validation schemas in a single transaction. This would reduce the need for additional API documentation and schema validation systems.

   - Data Visualization and Business Intelligence: BSS can be applied to data visualization platforms, where users manipulate and organize complex datasets within an interactive 2D grid. This could greatly enhance business intelligence tools, providing a more intuitive way to analyze and represent large data structures.

   - Programming Paradigms: BSS opens the door to new forms of visual programming, where developers can manipulate logic and data structures in a 2D space. This could inspire a new generation of programming languages or environments that prioritize spatial relationships, especially in domains like machine learning, simulation, and data processing.

## Conclusion

Binary Spatial Semantics (BSS) opens up new avenues for rethinking data representation and computation. By shifting the emphasis from content within individual cells to the spatial relationships between them, BSS challenges many of the assumptions that underlie traditional data structures and programming paradigms. This paper has demonstrated the core principles and foundational elements of BSS, exploring its practical applications in API design, recursive data structures, and visual programming environments.

## Exploring Wave Computing as a Future Extension

BSS’s grid-based structure also hints at unconventional computing paradigms, such as wave computing. Imagine a physical grid where each cell, represented by a node with transceiver capabilities, broadcasts and listens for signals—akin to walkie-talkies in a shared medium—rather than relying on linear data flow. Recursive CSV cells could map functions to specific nodes, enabling computation to propagate like waves across the grid. Nodes might process inputs based on signal strength, frequency, or spatial proximity, offering a non-linear alternative to traditional step-by-step logic. For example, a BSS grid could program a digital wave computer to recalculate dynamically (like a spreadsheet) or an analog system to evolve continuously, settling into repeating patterns. While still theoretical, this concept—explored in projects like the QUEN processor’s wavefront arrays—suggests BSS could someday bridge software and hardware innovation. Appendix B provides further details on this possibility, including potential operators for programming such systems.

and then here is a separate discussion of wave computing. how would you think to add this into the current paper, if at all. i want it to not take center stage but it is an interesting future possibility:

## Appendix B - Further Wave Computing Consideration

The potential of BSS extends beyond its immediate applications. One particularly intriguing possibility for future research is wave computing—a speculative approach that envisions a grid of computational nodes operating based on non-linear communication. In traditional computing, operations are carried out in a step-by-step manner, with inputs explicitly directed to functions. Wave computing introduces the idea of ambient, non-linear communication where nodes in a grid can "listen" and "broadcast" signals, similar to how humans can hear and respond to ambient sounds in a shared environment.

This paradigm shift could introduce new methods of programming where functions, or nodes, passively listen for specific signals to execute tasks, allowing for a continuous flow of computation rather than discrete, linear processes. As described in speculative scenarios of broadcast-based wave computing, nodes would be analogous to cells in BSS, capable of interacting not just based on direct input but by detecting signals broadcast by other nodes.

By utilizing recursive CSV cells — cells containing their own CSV grids — BSS can assign entire programs to specific points on the main grid. This allows for a direct mapping of computational nodes onto a physical grid, creating a real-world representation of the system. Such a setup opens the door to nonlinear, dynamic networks where the relationships between nodes can evolve continuously. This approach could inspire future research into wave computing, where spatial relationships drive new methods for digital signal processing and innovative grid-based hardware systems.

While much of this remains theoretical, wave computing represents an exciting frontier for BSS, with the potential to introduce broadcasted computation, nonlinear node communication, and ambient awareness into the grid-based programming model. Such advancements could redefine not only the way we structure and manipulate data but also how we conceptualize computation itself, making BSS a foundational layer for future computing paradigms.

In computing, we rarely using broadcasting. We have cell phones that broadcast data...to a specific cell tower, but that is still just a linear transmission of data. No other phones in our area "hear" that signal or at least pay any attention to it. They merely wait on communication to come from a specific cell tower nearby. Point-to-point communication is how computing is done.

However, in other types of communication, such as walkie-talkies or even just speaking into a room full of people, people can communicate with one another non-linearly. There are multiple recipients of the communication, and multiple senders, all on the same "channel" (at least in the case of talking, not so much walkie-talkies which only really allow one person to speak at a time although multiple people can hear it).

How would computing change if we considered how to utilize a paradigm where nodes communicate via a medium that does not enforce linear communication? How would you "program" these nodes? How would these nodes take advantage of this new medium to perform logic, calculations, and communications?

Imagine how different life would be if we didn't have sound. We wouldn't know all the subtleties about our environment that we pick up by passively listening to it. We can tell when someone is walking up behind us because we can hear them. We can tell how hard an engine is working by the sound it produces. We can hear our name called in a busy restaurant when our order is ready, and so can everyone else. There is a lot of information available to us but we don’t use most of it. We just know what to listen for.

Functions don’t have ambient awareness of the events taking place around them. Their inputs must specifically be assigned to them using some sort of linear process.

What if functions did have ambient awareness? What if they were always passively “listening” like we do?

In fact, what if there were a bunch of functions all listening to each other but they didn’t do anything until they heard something they knew to listen for. Then there could be constant activity amongst these functions like the conversations in a busy restaurant.

Some functions might be programmed to only process inputs from certain other functions, like you might only listen to the conversation at your table. However, they might also benefit from listening passively to other functions or even just for certain messages, such as you listening for the restaurant staff to say your name when your order is ready or responding if anyone loudly says “Fire!”

These functions could still be pure and have no side effects, even though their actions might still produce “sounds” in the environment as they processed their inputs. Other functions could then listen for specific sounds from these functions and potentially even predict their output before they produced it.

The functions might even take a back seat to the messages being sent around. Each function wouldn’t necessarily produce a complete meaningful result but a partial result that could be combined with the partial results from other functions to produce an end result. This would be very similar to the idea of partial function application except it would be partial function results.

### Programming Nonlinear Nodes in TreeTable

This is where TreeTable allows more expanded exploration into the possibilities of nonlinear computing. Imagine multiple recursive cells (cells with CSV inside of them) scattered across a grid in very specific locations. Each recursive cell contained a treet with a function that performed certain calculations. These treets were placed inside recursive cells so that each treet would only take up one cell on the grid, giving each function a very specific location relative to the others.

Now imagine this grid was reproduced in the real world by using a board with a 2 dimensional grid of nodes attached to it. These nodes would be positioned in rows and columns much like the cells on the TreeTable grid and each node could be a tiny computer with an antennae that listened for inputs and could broadcast outputs. A TreeTable grid could then be programmed into these nodes where the nodes on the board that corresponded to the nodes on the grid would activated. The nodes that were in the same position proportionally as a recursive cell on the TreeTable grid would have the function from that recursive cell programmed into it. When the grid was then turned on, each used node would then perform its function as it was programmed into the TreeTable grid. This setup would be much akin to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) which allow different combinations of logic gates to be programmed into them allowing them to emulate other hardware.

Computation could flow like waves across this array of nodes creating something we'll call "wave computing". Wave computing could be programmed in TreeTable using various paradigms and methods. The functions could listen for certain messages on certain frequencies, process those messages, and then broadcast a new message on a separate frequency. Frequencies may represent channels of communication or they may represent individual variables with the value for that variable being produced by multiple nodes at the same time. Radio waves could be used to communicate between the nodes, or light, or even sound.

The relative positioning of the nodes on the grid would affect how quickly messages would propagate between the nodes and these propagation characteristics could also be used somehow to facilitate even more interesting and complex computations.

Nodes could also use the relative strength of the signals being sent between various nodes. These combined signals could be used for computation where multiple nodes could calculate a result using different methods and the answer with the strongest combined signal wins.

This process would feel much like a spreadsheet recalculating all its values any time one cell value is changed. In fact, there may be two types of wave computers, digital and analogue.

Digital wave computers would work like a spreadsheet where discrete changes are made and then all the nodes on the grid update accordingly. Computing would proceed in this manner over and over one discrete change at a time.

Analog wave computers, on the other hand, would have nodes responding constantly to changes in the environment and other nodes would then respond to those nodes which could trigger some of the original nodes to respond and on and on, creating a constant ebb and flow of changes in the environment. Imagine a trading floor where traders constantly call out bids and asks while listening constantly for everyone else’s bids and asks so they can make a deal. There would be a constant hive of activity, all of it with a purpose which may not be obvious to observers.

Analog wave computers might still settle into a specific state, like digital wave computers. The difference is twofold. The settled state of an analog wave computer might be a repeating pattern of activity, not simply a situation where all nodes stop changing. Second, the settled state of an analog wave computer

A somewhat similar project to what we are discussing here was the QUEN processor which was a Memory-linked Wavefront Array Processor (MWAP). It used the characteristics of propagating waves (not true broadcast waves, but messages moving linearly through nodes) of computation to process results using recursive functions running on each compute node. It achieved some remarkable results.

We'll look more at Wave Computing in the examples at the end of the page, but for now we'll look at some basic operators that could be used in wave computing. Here are some things you might want to do in a wave function and what operator you would use for that:

### Send Operators

| Operator | Name      | Values          | Persistence  |
| -------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| `(`      | pulse     | 1 value         | 1 time       |
| `((`     | broadcast | 1 value         | continuously |
| `(((`    | packet    | multiple values | 1 time       |
| `((((`   | stream    | multiple values | continuously |

The operators above would be used when messages needed to be sent to other functions.

The equivalent functions below would be used when those types of messages needed to be received by a function (the direction of the operators is just reversed).

### Receive Operators

| Operator | Name      | Values          | Persistence  |
| -------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| `)`      | pulse     | 1 value         | 1 time       |
| `))`     | broadcast | 1 value         | continuously |
| `)))`    | packet    | multiple values | 1 time       |
| `))))`   | stream    | multiple values | continuously |

When listening for these signals, should you process a signal and then listen for another one or stop after the first one. If you do listen for subsequent signals, do you do that forever or eventually stop listening? Each time you receive a new signal, do you have to wait for the previous instance to finish processing or do you just process all the instances in parallel?

These kinds of questions can be answered by wrapping code in the operators below.

### Trigger Operators

#### Conditional Operators

| Operator | Character | Name   | Description                 |
| -------- | --------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `?`      | hmm       | while  | Execute while this is true  |
| `?`      | hmm       | unless | Execute unless this is true |
| `?`      | hmm       | when   | Execute when this is true   |

#### Repeat Operators

| Operator | Character | Name         | Description                                |
| -------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `?`      | hmm       | count        | Execute this number of times and then stop |
| `?`      | hmm       | continuously | Execute continuously                       |

#### Parallel Operators

| Operator | Character | Name     | Description                                                                                      |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `?`      | hmm       | single   | Wait for the previous instance to finish processing before processing a new signal               |
| `?`      | hmm       | wait     | Wait for certain conditions (such as an amount of time to elapse) before processing a new signal |
| `?`      | hmm       | parallel | Execute new instance as soon as conditions are met                                               |
|          |

For instance, if you wanted to create a function that just pulsed the number 3 once on channel 1 as soon as the computer turned on, you would create it like this:

```
(
    C1
    3
```

The first operand to the ( operator could just be the channel you wanted to use (C1 in this case for Channel 1) and the second operand could be the value you want to use (3 in this case).

Of course, how would this function know what Channel 1 meant? For this, you could convert the block above into a formal function with parameters and one of those parameters could be the channel to use.

Let's look at a little more interesting example of a function named Add1UnlessOverMax that:

accepts three parameters

a variable named `Max`
a channel named `Channel_A`
a channel named `Channel_B`

    waits for a pulse on Channel_A before it continues processing

    when it hears a pulse, it puts the value of that pulse in a variable named Value

    it then checks to see if the value of Value is less than or equal to Max

    if so, it adds 1 to Value (using the ++ operator) and broadcasts the new Value on Channel_B

    it then starts over at step 2 waiting for a new pulse

In other words, this function would increment a number (the value of the pulse on Channel_A) if that number was less than or equal to Max.

Here is what that would look like in TreeTable:

> TODO Fix formatting

Define
Add1UnlessOverMax
Max
Channel_A
Channel_B
)
Channel_A
Value
if
<=
Value
Max
(
Channel_B
++
Value

The function could then be used like this:

> TODO Fix formatting

Add1UnlessOverMax
5
440HZ
110HZ
Of course, as a block by itself, it's not very useful. It needs a neighbor to broadcast a pulse on Channel_A and another neighbor to listen for a pulse on Channel_B.

So, you could make it a part of a larger set of blocks that processed data in a loop up to 5 times.

> Insert Treet Here

There could even be special predicates (functions that only return a true or a false) in wave computing that could trigger other code to run only when they were true. For instance, what if you only wanted to do something if there is a change in a signal on a channel (it starts, stops, or the value of the signal changes compared with the last value of that signal) or if the channel has a certain status (nothing is being broadcast or something is being broadcast). Then you could use these operators to trigger other code to run when the conditions they represent are true.

### Operator (Character) Name Description

`/` (forward slash) a signal starts broadcasting on a channel (go high)

`\` (back slash) a signal stops broadcasting on a channel (go low)

`^` (carat) the value of a signal on a channel changes (delta)

`~` (tilde) there is something being broadcast on a channel

`-` (dash) there is nothing being broadcast on a channel
These could be used like this:

> Insert Treet Here

You might also want to consider time as a part of these predicates and, say, look back at the history of statuses on a channel and see if they match up to a certain pattern before continuing.

For instance, you could retrieve the last 10 seconds on a channel and see if the status changes on that channel match the pattern -.-. In other words, in the last 10 seconds was there ever a point where a signal started, stopped, and then started again?

There could even be a Wave Expression language that allowed you to find patterns in signal sequences much like Regular Expressions help you find patterns in signal sequences or Structural Expressions help you find patterns in structures. You could create a certain Wave Expression and then pass that to a function that checks for this pattern in a signal and returns true if it finds it, just like a Regular Expression works.

Wave computing could also think of each node as being "charged" and allowing it to lose energy over time, either reducing it's available output power gradually (analog) or waiting until the power output has reached a certain threshold and then it would not be able to broadcast at all (digital). The node could then be "charged up" by hearing certain inputs. As it heard more and more of those inputs, its energy would increase and it could start gradually (analog) or after a threshold (digital) start outputting a signal again.
