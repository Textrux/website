# Development Roadmap: Getting to Formatted Constructs

## The Big Picture Question

How do I get from "I have blocks and cell clusters" to "I can see trees and tables formatted nicely in my UI, and I can interact with them naturally"?

## The Core Challenge

Right now you're sitting in the foundation layer with spatial structures (blocks, cell clusters) but no semantic understanding. You need to bridge that gap to constructs (trees, tables, matrices) that have meaning and can be formatted and interacted with.

The temptation is to write algorithms that directly hunt for trees or tables, but that's brittle. Instead, you want to build a system that discovers semantic patterns from spatial traits - more like how a human would look at a grid and say "oh, that's obviously a tree structure."

## The Three-Part Solution

### Part 1: What Makes a Tree Look Like a Tree?

Before you can detect constructs, you need to understand what spatial patterns indicate semantic meaning. 

**For Trees:**
- There's a clear hierarchy visible in the spatial arrangement
- One cell/area acts as a root with others spatially arranged as children
- Children are consistently offset from parents (indented, or positioned down/right/etc)
- Siblings are aligned with each other
- The pattern has a consistent orientation

**For Tables:**
- Cells are arranged in clear rows and columns
- There's usually header information (top row, left column, or both)
- Data cells have consistent spacing and alignment
- The overall structure is grid-like

**For Key-Value:**
- Pairs of related cells (label and value)
- Consistent spatial relationship between labels and values
- Multiple pairs arranged in a sequence

The insight: instead of looking for "trees," look for "hierarchical spatial patterns with consistent orientation" and then recognize that as a tree.

### Part 2: From Patterns to Constructs

Once you can reliably detect these spatial patterns, you need to interpret them semantically:

**Pattern Recognition → Semantic Understanding**
- "Hierarchical pattern with down-right orientation" → "Tree growing down and right"
- "Grid pattern with top-row headers" → "Table with column headers" 
- "Paired cells in vertical sequence" → "Key-value list"

**Semantic Analysis**
- For the tree: which cell is the root? What are the parent-child relationships? How many levels deep?
- For the table: which cells are headers vs data? How many rows/columns?
- For key-value: which cells are keys vs values? What's the pairing pattern?

This semantic understanding is what enables formatting and interactions.

### Part 3: From Understanding to UI

Once you understand the semantic structure, you can format and enable interactions:

**Formatting**
- Trees get indentation, hierarchy colors, expand/collapse icons
- Tables get borders, header styling, alternating row colors
- Key-value gets label/value styling, consistent alignment

**Actions**
- Trees: "add sibling" knows where to insert based on tree orientation and current selection
- Tables: "add row" knows how to expand the table structure
- Key-value: "add pair" knows the spatial pattern to maintain

## The Stepwise Thinking Process

### Step 1: Enhance Your Spatial Analysis
Right now your trait system probably captures basic spatial info. You need it to capture relationships:
- Which cell clusters have parent-child spatial relationships?
- Which ones have peer relationships (siblings, table rows, key-value pairs)?
- What's the dominant orientation of these relationships?

### Step 2: Build Pattern Matchers
Create simple functions that look at spatial traits and say "this pattern indicates X construct type with Y confidence." Don't worry about perfect detection - even 80% accuracy with clear confidence scores is enough to start.

### Step 3: Create Semantic Models
For each construct type, build a simple model that captures the semantic structure:
- Tree: root node, parent-child relationships, hierarchy levels
- Table: header regions, data regions, row/column structure
- Key-Value: key-value pairs, sequence order

### Step 4: Build Formatters
For each construct type, create formatting rules that take the semantic model and output visual styling. Start simple - basic indentation for trees, basic borders for tables.

### Step 5: Define Actions
For each construct type, define the basic actions (add sibling, add child, add row, etc.) in terms of the semantic model. The action should know how to modify the semantic structure and let the formatter handle the visual updates.

## Key Design Principles

**Confidence Over Perfection**: Better to detect trees with 80% confidence and let users correct than to miss them entirely.

**Orientation Agnostic**: Don't assume trees grow down-right. Detect the orientation and adapt formatting accordingly.

**Pluggable Actions**: Actions should be registered based on construct type, so adding new construct types automatically gets the right action set.

**Semantic First**: Always think in terms of semantic structure (parent-child, key-value) rather than spatial coordinates. The spatial stuff is just for detection.

## The Mental Model

Think of it like this progression:
1. **Spatial**: "These cells are arranged in this pattern"
2. **Semantic**: "This pattern means these are tree nodes with these relationships"  
3. **Visual**: "Tree nodes should be formatted with indentation and hierarchy colors"
4. **Interactive**: "Tree actions should work on tree relationships, not cell coordinates"

Each layer builds on the previous but operates in its own domain. The spatial layer deals with positions and distances. The semantic layer deals with relationships and meaning. The visual layer deals with styling and formatting. The interactive layer deals with behaviors and actions.

## The Simplest Possible Start

Pick one construct type (probably trees since they're most visually obvious) and build the complete pipeline for just that:
1. Detect hierarchical spatial patterns in cell clusters
2. Build semantic tree model from those patterns  
3. Format tree nodes with basic indentation
4. Add one action (like "add sibling") that works on tree semantics

Once that works end-to-end, the pattern is established and you can replicate it for tables, matrices, and key-value pairs.

The goal isn't to solve everything at once - it's to prove the pattern works for one case, then scale it up.
