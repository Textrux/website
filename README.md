Textrux (short for Text Structures > Text Strux > Textrux) is a content-driven-formatting grid that finds structures using the placement of the text on the grid.

The purpose of this site is to be a proof of concept for spatial semantics with the eventual goal of using CSV/bitmaps to convey rich complex semantics between computers using a simple interface.
