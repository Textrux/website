Text Structures in simple CSV.

CSV is now a fully expressive, rich medium for expressing complex ideas, programs, and data in a well known, universal format.

[Textrux.com](https://www.textrux.com) is where you can see it in action. Enter text in the cells like you would do in any spreadsheet application, except you'll see that text come to life in structures that form based on where you enter that text.

### Create a table

### Create a tree

### Create a treetable

### Create a block cluster

## Embedded grids

CSV is a very versatile format, you can even put CSV inside CSV. When we do that it creates embedded grids.

## Elevated grids

In the same way that you can "zoom in" on a cell with CSV inside to see the embedded grid, you can also "zoom out" on a group of cells and see the cells merge to form an elevated grid. The original cells inside each merged cell are resolved to a single value visible in the elevated grid. Just as you can embed grids inside grids ad infinitum, you can also merge grids to form elevated grids ad infinitum.

## Grid groups

A single CSV file can represent everything in Textrux including multiple grids just like you would see tabs in a spreadsheet application.
